# JavaConcepts
Exercises from the Java Concepts textbook.

This is the 5th edition which covers Java 5 & 6, and is written by Cay Horstmann.

Overall, it's been a useful book, although the exercises seem extraordinarily heavy on the assumption that the reader already has a high mathematical understanding, which I currently do not have.  While I appreciate chances to increase my maths ability, it's making it harder to understand the java reasoning when I'm having to learn both things at the same time.  Bah.
